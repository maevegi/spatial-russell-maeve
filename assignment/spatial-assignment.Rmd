# Introduction to the Data Set
In August 2020, [Christopher Schell](http://directory.tacoma.uw.edu/employee/cjschell) and collegues published a review in *Science* on ['The ecological and evolutionary consequences of systemic racism in urban environments'](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/08/12/science.aay4497) (DOI: 10.1126/science.aay4497), showing how systematic racism and classism  has significant impacts on ecological and evolutionary processes within urban environments. Here we explore a subset of the data used to support these findings in this review and the broader literature.

In order to examine the continuing effects of redlining, we are using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for San Francisco and comparing it to a map of loan grade districts, also known as a redlining. We are also going to compare the redlining and NDVI maps of San Francisco and San Jose. The loan grade areas were based on a scale from A to D based on "mortgage security risk" assigned by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC). Zones with a grade of A were considered the least risky, while D was considered the lowest grade for high risk neighborhoods. In these low-grade districts it was much harder to get loans to purchase houses. The justification for the risk assessment was often if not always deeply motivated by racist policy which made it difficult for people of color to secure a loan to buy a house. Redlining not only has an economic impact even today, but also impacts other aspects of the urban areas, including the distribution of vegetation.  

**Figure 1** Professor Schell's paper shows how NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) tracks historical redlining.

We are utilizing spatial data from the following source:  https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=3/41.245/-105.469&text=intro

**1.Mapping Inequality:** 
We first need to read in the shape files for the cities we are going to examine. 
```{r}

san_fran_zip <- "https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/static/downloads/shapefiles/CASanFrancisco1937.zip"
san_josezip<- "https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/static/downloads/shapefiles/CASanJose1937.zip"

san_franurl <- paste0("/vsizip/vsicurl/", san_fran_zip)
san_joseurl<-paste0("/vsizip/vsicurl/", san_josezip)
sf <- read_sf(san_franurl)
sf3<- read_sf(san_joseurl)

sf
sf3
```
Here we want to view the shapefiles for the two cities we are examining, San Francisco (sf) and San Jose (sf3). 
```{r}
tmap_mode("view") #hashtag this later when knitting 
tm_shape(sf) + tm_polygons("holc_grade", alpha=0.5)
tm_shape(sf3)+ tm_polygons("holc_grade", alpha=0.5)
```

Next, we needed to specify the coordinates for the perimeter of the city, beginning with San Francisco. We also need to specify the date range for which we want the data. Once we have the shape and time span defined, we can extract the necessary NDVI data collected from the Sentinel 2 satellite. 
```{r}
box<- st_bbox(sf)
start_date <- "2022-06-01"
end_date <- "2022-08-31"
items <- 
  stac("https://earth-search.aws.element84.com/v0/") |>
  stac_search(collections = "sentinel-s2-l2a-cogs",
              bbox =c(box),
              datetime = paste(start_date, end_date, sep="/"),
              limit = 100) |>
  post_request() 
```
Because NDVI is collected from satellite data, we specify which bands of light we are going to examine, in this case green, and exclude any values with more than 20% cloud cover. 
```{r}
col <-
  stac_image_collection(items$features,
                        asset_names = c("B02", "B03", "B04","B08", "SCL"),
                        property_filter = \(x) {x[["eo:cloud_cover"]] < 20})
```
Using the data we extracted and the time span and dimensions of our area of study, we can create a spatiotemporal data cube with all of this information. 
```{r}
cube <- cube_view(srs = "EPSG:4326",  
                  extent = list(t0 = start_date, t1 = "2022-08-31",
                                left = box[1], right = box[3],
                                top = box[4], bottom = box[2]),
                  nx = 1000, ny = 1000, dt = "P1M",
                  aggregation = "median", resampling = "average")

S2.mask <- image_mask("SCL", values=c(3,8,9)) # mask clouds and cloud shadows
```
Once we have defined the data cube, we need to apply the calculation for NDVI using the specified data bands for infrared and near-infrared light. 
```{r}
ndvi <- 
  raster_cube(col, cube, mask = S2.mask) |>
  select_bands(c("B08", "B04")) |>
  apply_pixel("(B08-B04)/(B08+B04)", "NDVI") |>
  aggregate_time("P3M") 

```
To map the data, we want to examine the average NDVI value of all of the pixels within each HOLC grade district. 
```{r}
avg_ndvi<-ndvi|>
extract_geom(sf, FUN=mean)
avg_ndvi|>as_tibble()
sf_new<- sf|> rowid_to_column("FID")
ndvi_polygons<- left_join(sf_new, avg_ndvi)
ndvi_polygons
```
Once we have the average values by each district, we want to plot these NDVI values onto the polygons of the HOLC districts. The darker green polygons have higher NDVI values, while the lighter green indicates lower NDVI values. The letters A-D indicate the HOLC grade.
```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_basemap()+
tm_shape(ndvi_polygons)+tm_polygons("NDVI", style="quantile", palette="Greens")+
  tm_shape(ndvi_polygons)+ tm_text("holc_grade", size=0.5)
```
While the map gives us a visual representation of the data, it is difficult to determine with certainty whether areas with higher grades of A or B have higher NDVI values. In order to determine whether there is a correlation between the two values, we need to look at the average NDVI values for each HOLC grade. 
```{r}
ndvi_polygons|>as_tibble()|>
 group_by(holc_grade)|>
 summarise(mean_NDVI=mean(NDVI))

```
Based on the average values by HOLC grade district, it seems that the grade A polygons have the highest average NDVI value, followed by grade B. Grades C and D are very similar, although grade C is slightly higher. 


Finally, we want to examine the HOLC grade polygon map directly on top of the NDVI values as another visual representation of the correlation between the two values. 
```{r}
ndvi2<- ndvi|> st_as_stars()
sf_ndvi<-tm_shape(ndvi2)+ tm_raster()+ tm_shape(sf) + tm_polygons("holc_grade", alpha=0.5)+ tm_layout(legend.position=c("right", "bottom"))
sf_ndvi
```
##Examining NDVI Values for San Jose

We want to compare the NDVI values of San Francisco with another city within the Bay Area. Our city of choice is San Jose. First we need to define a new bounding box with the same time span but with the boundaries of the San Jose shapefile (sf3).  
```{r}
box2<- st_bbox(sf3)
start_date <- "2022-06-01"
end_date <- "2022-08-31"
items <- 
  stac("https://earth-search.aws.element84.com/v0/") |>
  stac_search(collections = "sentinel-s2-l2a-cogs",
              bbox =c(box2),
              datetime = paste(start_date, end_date, sep="/"),
              limit = 100) |>
  post_request() 

```

Again, we are repeating the same processes with the new bounding box for San Jose. 
```{r}
cube2 <- cube_view(srs = "EPSG:4326",  
                  extent = list(t0 = start_date, t1 = "2022-08-31",
                                left = box2[1], right = box2[3],
                                top = box2[4], bottom = box2[2]),
                  nx = 1000, ny = 1000, dt = "P1M",
                  aggregation = "median", resampling = "average")

S2.mask <- image_mask("SCL", values=c(3,8,9)) # mask clouds and cloud shadows
cube2
```

Next, we need to make a new raster cube and apply the calculations for NDVI to the cube we created for San Jose. 
```{r}
sf3_ndvi <- 
  raster_cube(col, cube2, mask = S2.mask) |>
  select_bands(c("B08", "B04")) |>
  apply_pixel("(B08-B04)/(B08+B04)", "NDVI") |>
  aggregate_time("P3M") 
sf3_ndvi
```

To map the data, we want to examine the average of all of the pixels within each HOLC grade district.
```{r}
sf3_avg_ndvi<-sf3_ndvi|>
  extract_geom(sf3, FUN=mean)
sf3_avg_ndvi|>as_tibble()
sf3_new<- sf3|> rowid_to_column("FID")
sf3_polygons<- left_join(sf3_new, sf3_avg_ndvi)
sf3_polygons
```

Like we did for San Francisco, we need to combine the NDVI polygons with the HOLC grade polygons and map them together. As before, each polygon has a letter corresponding to the HOLC grade. The darker polygons have a higher NDVI value and therefore have more green vegetation. 
```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")
sanjose_NDVI<-tm_basemap()+
tm_shape(sf3_polygons)+tm_polygons("NDVI", style="quantile", palette="Greens")+
  tm_shape(sf3_polygons)+ tm_text("holc_grade", size=0.5)+tm_layout(legend.width=0.5)

sanjose_NDVI
```

Finally, we summarize the mean NDVI values for each HOLC grade assignment. 
```{r}
sf3_polygons|>as_tibble()|>
 group_by(holc_grade)|>
 summarise(mean_NDVI=mean(NDVI))
```

Overall, San Jose has higher mean NDVI values for all HOLC grades. For both cities, the highest NDVI values are for HOLC grade A. NDVI decreases through grades B to D. This supports the theory that Dr. Schell described whereby historical redlining conducted during the 1930s continues to have an ecological impact on cities in the present. 

The maps we generated showcase the real-life consequences of human policies on an ecological scale. Systemic racism created unequal distributions of biomass and greenness in cities. This has multiple implications for biodiversity and response to climate change. Neighborhoods with greater NDVI typically should be able to support greater biodiversity as they provide habitat and food sources for more species. More trees and canopy cover also shade neighborhoods and provide aesthetic value. In neighborhoods with lower historical HOLC grades, lower biodiversity values not only mean less aesthetic value, but have greater consequences for human health. Areas with less shade are subject to the urban heat island effect, where radiation is absorbed and re-readiated by concrete and asphalt cover in urban areas. As global temperatures increase, cities will be subject to hotter temperatures, amplified by a lack of tree cover. 

In the field of global change ecology, the importance of studying urban ecology is becoming increasingly recognized as a relevant field as human expansion continues. Therefore it is important for those studying this field to be aware of the history and policy decisions that continue to affect urban areas and the impact it has on ecology. There is an increasing acknowledgement of the relationship between human developed areas and nature, and that they are not completely isolated from one another. Moving forward these studies can help unify both groups and add insight to future management decisions.
