## assignment
For this assignment, we examined the consequences of historical redlining on NDVI values in the present. We used spatial data (polygons and rasters) to map redlining districts, or areas given grades based on "mortage risk" which were informed by racist policy decisions. We then took NDVI data of the chosen cities and mapped it onto the distribution of HOLC grade districts, and examined if tehre was any correlation between the two values. This work was based on a paper done by Christopher Schell that examined redlining and NDVI across multiple cities in the US (https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/08/12/science.aay4497).
